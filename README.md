This repository demonstrates a common TypeScript error: Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'number'. The bug.ts file contains code that leads to this error, while bugSolution.ts provides a corrected version.  The error arises from implicit type coercion or unexpected string input where a number is expected. The solution involves explicit type checking and handling of potential string inputs to prevent type mismatches.
